## General Info  

In order to analyze the water quality of reservoirs by remote sensing, such as satellites, bio-optical models were used. Those models are mathematical and statistical algorithms that generate information about water bodies.

Currently, this project performs calculations for models that estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a, suspended solids, water transparency, turbidity, cyanobacteria and macrophytes in aquatic environments.

  
  
## Getting Started  

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
  
  
### Technologies

To execute this project, you'll need the following technologies:
  
- 32- or 64-bit computer
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


### Development

To start the development, it is necessary to clone or download Bitbucket repository in a directory of your choice:  
  
  
```git clone https://user@bitbucket.org/certi_repos/qda_modelos.git```


### Usage

This repository can be used as a complementary library for a main project and its modules can be used whenever they are necessary. 
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

To install dependencies use the following command:  
  
```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

You can install dependencies directly in your machine or in a virtual environment of your choice, such as [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
